# Problem 2

In windows partition a disk drive into 3 partition

**1. for doing partitions in a hard drive, first we have to turn on the VM, then we navigate to disk managment.
2. then we chose the drive we want to partion (eg. Disk 1)
3. initialize the disk using either MBR or GPT
4. then right click the unalocated space of the drive and click new simple volume option 
5. then select the size, letter that you want to assign and then format the partition.
6. then repeat the same steps to create more partitions. **
